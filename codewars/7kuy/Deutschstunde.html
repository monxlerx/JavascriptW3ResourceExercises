        Everybody knows a little german, right? But remembering the correct articles is a tough job. Write yourself a little helper, that returns the noun with the matching article:

        eqach noun containing less than 2 vowels has the article "das"
        each noun containing 2/3 vowels has the article "die"
        each noun containing more than 3 vowels has the article "der"
        Caution: Vowels are "a,e,i,o,u". Umlaute (ä ö ü) are also being counted!

        (This Kata is a joke, there is no such grammar rule!)                                           
        */
       console.log(derDieDas("Ofenkartoffeiiil"));

        function derDieDas(wort){
            if (wort.length === 0) return `das `;

            let lowerCaseArr = wort.toLowerCase().split('');
            let vowelCounter = 0;
            lowerCaseArr.map((char) => {
                if (/[aeiouäöü]/.test(char)) {
                    vowelCounter++;
                }
            }) ;

            return (vowelCounter < 2) ? `das ${wort}` : (vowelCounter === 2 || vowelCounter === 3) ? `die ${wort}` : `der ${wort}`;
        }
