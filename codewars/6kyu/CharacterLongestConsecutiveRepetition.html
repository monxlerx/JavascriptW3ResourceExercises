        For a given string s find the character c (or C) with longest consecutive repetition and return:

        [c, l]
        where l (or L) is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same l return the first in order of appearance.

        For empty string return:

        ["", 0]
        In JavaScript: If you use Array.sort in your solution, you might experience issues with the random tests as Array.sort is not stable in the Node.js version used by CodeWars. This is not a kata issue.

        Happy coding! :)
