      /*
        Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

        Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,

        solve(["abode","ABc","xyzD"]) = [4, 3, 1]
        See test cases for more examples.

        Input will consist of alphabet characters, both uppercase and lowercase. No spaces.

        Good luck!

      console.log(solve([["abode", "ABc", "xyzD"]]));
