        /*
        Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

        There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

        Examples
        [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
        [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
        [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
        [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
        [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).
