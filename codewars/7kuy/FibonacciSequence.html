        You will be given a function, isFibo, which will take three arguments: a, b and f.

        a is the first term of a Fibonacci sequence, b is the second term of this sequence ( it will always be bigger than or equal to a and they'll be both always positive, so don't worry about pesky input checking ) and f is a number which you'll need to check whether or not is a part of this Fibonacci sequence.

        Good luck, muh fellow coding warrior.
