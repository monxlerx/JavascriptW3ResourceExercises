              This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students

              All Star Code Challenge #1

              Write a function, called sumPPG, that takes two NBA player objects/struct/Hash/Dict/Class and sums their PPG

              Examples:
              function NBAplayer(name, team, ppg){
              this.name=name;
              this.team=team;
              this.ppg=ppg;
              }
              */
            var iverson = new NBAplayer("Iverson", "76ers", 11.2);
            var jordan = new NBAplayer("Jordan", "bulls", 20.2);

            function NBAplayer(name, team, ppg){
            this.name=name;
            this.team=team;
            this.ppg=ppg;
            }

            console.log(sumPPG(iverson, jordan));

            function sumPPG(playerOne, playerTwo) {
                return playerOne.ppg + playerTwo.ppg;
            }
