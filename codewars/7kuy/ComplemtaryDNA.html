        /*
        Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

        If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

        In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

        More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

        Example: (input --> output)

        "ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
        "GTAT" --> "CATA"
        dnaStrand []        `shouldBe` []
        dnaStrand [A,T,G,C] `shouldBe` [T,A,C,G]
        dnaStrand [G,T,A,T] `shouldBe` [C,A,T,A]
        dnaStrand [A,A,A,A] `shouldBe` [T,T,T,T]
        */

        console.log(DNAStrand("ATTGC"));

        function DNAStrand(dna) {
            const DNA = {
                A: "T",
                T: "A",
                G: "C",
                C: "G",
            }

            return dna.split('').map((symbol) => DNA[symbol]).join('');
        }
