      /*
        You have an amount of money a0 > 0 and you deposit it with an interest rate of p percent divided by 360 per day on the 1st of January 2016. You want to have an amount a >= a0.

        Task:
        The function date_nb_days (or dateNbDays...) with parameters a0, a, p will return, as a string, the date on which you have just reached a.

        Example:
        date_nb_days(100, 101, 0.98) --> "2017-01-01" (366 days)

        date_nb_days(100, 150, 2.00) --> "2035-12-26" (7299 days)

        Notes:
        The return format of the date is "YYYY-MM-DD"
        The deposit is always on the "2016-01-01"
        Don't forget to take the rate for a day to be p divided by 36000 since banks consider that there are 360 days in a year.
        You have: a0 > 0, p% > 0, a >= a0
        */

      const ln = Math.log;

      function dateNbDays(a0, a, p) {
        let days = Math.ceil((ln(a) - ln(a0)) / ln(1 + p / 36000));
        var date = new Date(2016, 0, 1 + days);
        return date.toISOString().split("T")[0];
