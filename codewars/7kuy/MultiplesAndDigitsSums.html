        In this exercise, you will create a function that takes an integer, i. With it you must do the following:

        Find all of its multiples up to and including 100,

        Then take the digit sum of each multiple (eg. 45 -> 4 + 5 = 9),

        And finally, get the total sum of each new digit sum.

        Note: If the digit sum of a number is more than 9 (eg. 99 -> 9 + 9 = 18) then you do NOT have to break it down further until it reaches one digit.
