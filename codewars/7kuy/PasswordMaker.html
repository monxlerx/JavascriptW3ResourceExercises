        /*
        One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a memorable phrase or sentence and make a password by extracting the first letter of each word.

        Even better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g., the letter O can be replaced with the number 0):

        instead of including i or I put the number 1 in the password;
        instead of including o or O put the number 0 in the password;
        instead of including s or S put the number 5 in the password.
        Examples:
        "Give me liberty or give me death"  --> "Gml0gmd"
        "Keep Calm and Carry On"            --> "KCaC0"
        */

        console.log(makePassword('Keep Calm and Carry On'));

        function makePassword(phrase) {
            let phraseArr = phrase.split(' ');
            let password = [];

            phraseArr.map(word => {
                if (word.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() === 'I') {
                    password.push(1);
                } else if (word.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() === 'O') {
                    password.push(0);
                } else if (word.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() === 'S') {
                    password.push(5);
                } else {
                    password.push(word.substring(0, 1));
                }
            })

            return password.join('');
        }
