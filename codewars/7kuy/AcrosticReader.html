        An acrostic is a text in which the first letter of each line spells out a word. It is also a quick and cheap way of writing a poem for somebody, as exemplified below :
        Write a program that reads an acrostic to identify the "hidden" word. Specifically, your program will receive a list of words (reprensenting an acrostic) and will need to return a string corresponding to the word that is spelled out by taking the first letter of each word in the acrostic.
        */

        console.log(readOut(['Jolly', 'Amazing', 'Courteous', 'Keen']));

        function readOut(acrostic) {
            let result = "";
            acrostic.map(word => result += word.substring(0,1));
            return result;
        }
