        Imagine there's a big cube consisting of n3 n^3n 
        3
        small cubes. Calculate, how many small cubes are not visible from outside.

        For example, if we have a cube which has 4 cubes in a row, then the function should return 8, because there are 8 cubes inside our cube (2 cubes in each dimension)
