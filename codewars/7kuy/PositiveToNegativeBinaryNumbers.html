      /*
        Given an array of ones and zero(e)s that represents a positive binary number, convert the number to two's complement value.

        Two's complement is the way most computers represent positive or negative integers. The most significant bit is 1 if the number is negative, and 0 otherwise.

        Examples:

        [1,1,1,1] = -1

        [1,0,0,0] = -8

        [1,1,0,1] = -3

        To get the two's complement negative notation of an integer, you take the number in binary.

        You then flip the bits, and add one (with carry) to the result.

        For example:

        [0,0,1,0] = 2 in base 10

        [1,1,0,1] <- Flip the bits

        Add 1 (with carry):

        [1,1,1,0] = -2

        The output array must have the same length as the input array.
        */

      console.log(positiveToNegative([0, 1, 0, 0, 1]), [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]);

      function positiveToNegative(a) {
        a = a.map((x) => 1 - x);
        for (let i = a.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          a[i] = 1 - a[i];
          if (a[i]) break;
        }
        return a;
      }
