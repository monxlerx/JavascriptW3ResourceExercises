        Imagine you start on the 5th floor of a building, then travel down to the 2nd floor, then back up to the 8th floor. You have travelled a total of 3 + 6 = 9 floors of distance.

        Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order.

        // simple examples
        elevatorDistance([5,2,8]) = 9
        elevatorDistance([1,2,3]) = 2
        elevatorDistance([7,1,7,1]) = 18

        // if two consecutive floors are the same,
        //distance travelled between them is 0
        elevatorDistance([3,3]) = 0
        Array will always contain at least 2 floors. Random tests will contain 2-20 elements in array, and floor values between 0 and 30.
