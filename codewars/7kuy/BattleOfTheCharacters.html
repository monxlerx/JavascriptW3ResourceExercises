        Description:
        Groups of characters decided to make a battle. Help them to figure out which group is more powerful. Create a function that will accept 2 variables and return the one who's stronger.

        Rules:
        Each character have its own power: A = 1, B = 2, ... Y = 25, Z = 26
        Only capital characters can and will participate a battle.
        Only two groups to a fight.
        Group whose total power (A + B + C + ...) is bigger wins.
        If the powers are equal, it's a tie.
        Examples:
        battle("ONE", "TWO"); // => "TWO"`
        battle("ONE", "NEO"); // => "Tie!"
        */

        function battle(x, y) {
            const alphabet = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z"];
            let xSum = 0;
            let ySum = 0;

            x.split('').map(char => xSum += checkPower(alphabet, char));
            y.split('').map(char => ySum += checkPower(alphabet, char));

            return (xSum > ySum) ? x : (ySum > xSum) ? y : 'Tie!';
        }

        function checkPower(alphabet, c) {
            for (let i = 0; i < alphabet.length; i++) {
                if (c === alphabet[i]) return i + 1;
            }
