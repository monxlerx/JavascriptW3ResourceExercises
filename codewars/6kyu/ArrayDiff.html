        Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
        It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
        
        arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
        If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
        
        arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
        */
       
      console.log(arrayDiff([], [4, 5]));
      console.log(arrayDiff([3, 4], [3]));
      console.log(arrayDiff([1, 8, 2], []));
      console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2, 3], [1,2]));

        return a.filter(e => !b.includes(e));
