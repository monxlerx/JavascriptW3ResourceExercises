        In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

        years divisible by 4 are leap years
        but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
        but years divisible by 400 are leap years
        Additional Notes:

        Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
        Examples can be found in the test fixture.
